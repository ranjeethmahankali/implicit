# implicit

I was quite impressed by [nTopology's implicit modeling
software](https://ntopology.com/) and wanted to experiment with it
myself.

### Using the application

So far its just a console application with a REPL interface. As you
input commands, you will see the new geometry being created in the
viewer.

### Viewer

I am building a rendering pipeline to visualize geometry that is
implicitly defined, from scratch using OpenCL and OpenGL.

### Documentation

Work in progress.

### Example

This is an example of what can be created with this application with
just a few commands.
